# Natural Stories Corpus

This is a corpus of naturalistic stories meant to contain varied, low-frequency syntactic constructions.
There are a variety of annotations and psycholinguistic measures available for the stories.

The stories in with their various annotations are coordinated around the file `words.tsv`, which specifies a unique code for each token in the story under a variety of different tokenization schemes.
For example, the following lines in `words.tsv` cover the phrase `the long-beareded mill owners.`:
"""
1.54.whole      the
1.54.word       the
1.54.1  the
1.55.whole      long - bearded
1.55.word       long - bearded
1.55.1  long
1.55.2  -
1.55.3  bearded
1.56.whole      mill
1.56.word       mill
1.56.1  mill
1.57.whole      owners .
1.57.word       owners
1.57.1  owners
1.57.2  .
"""

The first column is the token code; the second is the token itself. For example, `1.57.whole` represents the token `owners.` and `1.57.word` represents the token `owners`.
The token code consists of three fields:

1. The id of the story the token is found in,
2. The number of the token in the story,
3. An additional field whose value is `whole` for the entire token including punctuation, `word` for the token stripped of punctuation to the left and right, and then 1 through n for each sub-token in `whole` as defined by NLTK's TreebankWordTokenizer.

The various annotations (frequencies, parses, RTs, etc.) should reference these codes so that we can track tokens uniformly.
